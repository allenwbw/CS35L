1. mkdir ~/gitroot create a directory called gitroot
2. cd gitroot
3. git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git and get a copy of the 
   Diffutils Git repository.
4. cd diffutils
5. git log > ~/git-log.txt put the log of master branch into git-log.txt
6. git tag > ~/git-tags.txt put the list of tags into git-tags.txt
7. search git-log.txt for the hash key of the commit "maint: quote 'like this'
   or "like this", not `like this'"
8. use the command 'git format-patch -1 <hash key> --stdout > 
   ../quote-patch.txt' to generate a patch for the commit.
9. git checkout v3.0 checkout version 3.0
10. 'patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt' command to apply the previously generated
    patch.
11. skipped some files and use the command 'git status' to see which file 
    is modified.
12. inspect all the non-'.c' files listed and undo all the changes with 
    emacs commands 'C-x v =' and 'C-x v u'
13. Manually inspect all the '*.c' files and undo all the changes that are not
    character string changes by comparing the current file with previous
    version shown by the command 'C-x v ='
14. use emacs to inspect all the '*.c.rej' files and apply all the change to
    its corresponding '*.c' file.
15. use the commands 'git clean -n' and 'git clean -f' to remove untracked 
    files
16. 'git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt' generate a new patch
17. generate executable with the command'./bootstrap' './configure' and 'make'
    as illustrated by the README-hacking file
18. run the commands 'src/diff . -' and 'src/diff --help', verifying that the
    quotes are with '' not `'.
19. create directory 'mkdir ../diffutils-3.0-patch' and 
    'mkdir ../diffutils-3.0'
20. copy src folder to ../diffutils-3.0-patch
21. checkout version 3.0, copy src folder to ../diffutils-3.0
22. run diffutils-3.0-patch/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch 
    >quote-3.0-test.txt
23. the files are not identical so the change is not innocuous.
