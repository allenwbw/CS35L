Q1:
  The "case_long_iso_time_style:" is a goto statement and is already caught
  by the switch statement, so is not necessary to remove it.
Q2:
   Since the coreutils now display unix formatted date no matter the locale
   setting, people in countries that do not speak English or use such time 
   format will have trouble understanding the time display. 
Q3:
   It print out the following error:
   Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py", line 261, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq 
    is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
   Such error is caused by the program trying to access a list with index
   beyond the length of the list.
Q4:
 The program prints the following error:
 File "./randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
 SyntaxError: invalid syntax
 Python3 has a different sytax than randline.py.
